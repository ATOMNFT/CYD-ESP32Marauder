  <b>Files and repo not ready yet. I'm in process of testing a fix and uping things to this repo.</b>
  
  <b>A beautiful fork of wifi Maraduer, a suite of WiFi/Bluetooth offensive and defensive tools for the 2.8'' ESP32 Module ESP32-2432S028R WiFi+BT Dual-core 240X320 Smart Display.</b>
  <b>This fork features a few great fixes and customzations.</b><br><br>
  # Adjusted sd card portal storage
  I have tweaked a section of two files (EvilPortal.cpp & SDInterface) to allow the portals used in EP to be stored in a folder on the sd card instead of just being stored in the root folder. </b>
  
  <br> 
  <b>The folder must be titled "portals" and I will include a zip with the folder and the ap.config file to upload directly to a sd card to use in the CYD</b>
