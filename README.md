<b>A beautiful fork of wifi Marauder, a suite of WiFi/Bluetooth offensive and defensive tools for the 2.8'' ESP32 Module ESP32-2432S028R WiFi+BT Dual-core 240X320 Smart Display.</b>
<b>This fork features a few great fixes and customzations.</b>

## Device Compatibility

Successfully tested on both of these devices:
- [CYD variant 1](https://amazon.com/dp/B0BVFXR313)
- [CYD variant 2](https://amazon.com/dp/B0CLR7MQ91)

No hardware modifications required thanks to integration with **@ggaljoen's** [TFT_eSPI](https://github.com/ggaljoen/TFT_eSPI) fork.

## ðŸ“¡ GPS Functionality ðŸ“¡

- GPS is enabled on builds 13.10 & 1.0.0 not labled (NoGPS) in the flasher tool and it is fully operational through the 4-pin connector located near the MicroUSB port of the CYD module. 
<br>
For build 1.1.0 GPS is fully working with no confilcts affecting led or detect pwnagotchi.

## ðŸ’¾ SD portal fix ðŸ’¾

  <b> This fix is to relocate all the portals for evil portal to a folder on the sd card. When you install Marauder on the CYD all the protals used in evil portal get stored on the root of the sd card. To me this is a nuisance as all the pcap and other files that are captured while sniffing get thrown on the root of the sd as well. I have gone through and adjusted the code so you may create a folder titled "portals" and store the html files there.<br>In the <a href=https://github.com/ATOMNFT/CYD-ESP32Marauder/tree/master/Evil%20Portal%20Stuff>Evil Portal</a> section are the files needed along with directions on usage. </b>
  
  ## SD Setup for CM-Box
If you flashed from the <a href=https://atomnft.github.io/CM-Box/flash0.html>Custom Marauder Flasher tool for CYD</a> or built from <a href=https://github.com/ATOMNFT/CYD-ESP32Marauder>CYD-ESP32Marauder</a> then You must create a folder on the root of your sd card titled "portals". This is where you will store the <a href=https://github.com/ATOMNFT/CYD-ESP32Marauder/tree/master/Evil%20Portal%20Stuff>Evil Portal html files</a> along with the index.html file.

## ðŸ”§ To build this fork of Marauder from source ðŸ”§

- Head over to <a href=https://github.com/smoochiee/Marauder-FOR-CYD---CHEAP-YELLOW-DISPLAY>smoochiee's tutorial</a> and start from step 1 in his tut.
- When you get to the "LIBRARIES" section you can use the libs he has linked or the ones in this repo which are the same.
- Now on the step in smoochiee's tutorial where he mentions to download the source code for Marauder, use the files from  <a href=https://github.com/ATOMNFT/CYD-ESP32Marauder/tree/master/CYD%20ESP32%20Marauder%2013.10%20(NoGPS)>CYD ESP32 Marauder 13.10 (NoGPS)</a> or <a href=https://github.com/ATOMNFT/CYD-ESP32Marauder/tree/master/CYD%20ESP32%20Marauder%201.0.0%20(NoGPS)>CYD ESP32 Marauder 1.0.0 (NoGPS)</a> instead (These files contain the sketch edits already). Then head back to <a href=https://github.com/smoochiee/Marauder-FOR-CYD---CHEAP-YELLOW-DISPLAY>smoochiee's tutorial</a> and Follow the rest of the steps provided by the legend himself and you should be good to go. I will be adding my own tutorial for flashing this build to your CYD very shortly.
