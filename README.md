<b>For more of the changes and additions to marauder, head over <a href=https://github.com/justcallmekoko/ESP32Marauder/releases/tag/v1.1.0>HERE</a> And read more</b>

<br>

<b>A beautiful fork of wifi Marauder, a suite of WiFi/Bluetooth offensive and defensive tools for the 2.8'' ESP32 Module ESP32-2432S028R WiFi+BT Dual-core 240X320 Smart Display.</b>
<b>This fork features a few great fixes and customzations.</b>

<hr>
<br>
  
> ## üõ†Ô∏è **Device Compatibility**
> 
> Successfully tested on:
> - [CYD variant 1](https://amazon.com/dp/B0BVFXR313)  
> - [CYD variant 2](https://amazon.com/dp/B0CLR7MQ91)  
> 
> **‚ú® No hardware modifications required!**  
> This is made possible thanks to seamless integration with **[@ggaljoen](https://github.com/ggaljoen)'s** [TFT_eSPI](https://github.com/ggaljoen/TFT_eSPI) fork.

<hr>

> ## üì° **GPS Functionality** üì°
> 
> - **GPS is enabled** on builds `13.10` & `1.0.0` (not labeled as "NoGPS" in the flasher tool).  
>   It is fully operational via the 4-pin connector located near the MicroUSB port on the CYD module.  
> 
> - For build `1.1.0`, GPS is fully functional with **no conflicts** affecting LED or Pwnagotchi detection.  
> 
> üîó [Check here](https://github.com/justcallmekoko/ESP32Marauder/wiki/gps-modification) for details on supported GPS hardware.

<hr>
<br>

> ## üíæ **SD Portal Fix** üíæ
> 
> This fix relocates all portals for Evil Portal to a dedicated folder on the SD card.  
> When you install Marauder on the CYD, all the portals used in Evil Portal are stored on the root of the SD card. This can be a nuisance as PCAP and other files captured during sniffing also clutter the root directory.  
> 
> With this update, you can create a folder titled `portals` to store the HTML files.  
> Visit the [Evil Portal](https://github.com/ATOMNFT/CYD-ESP32Marauder/tree/master/Evil%20Portal%20Stuff) section for the necessary files and detailed usage instructions.  
> 
> ---
> 
> ## **SD Setup for CM-Box**
> 
> If you flashed from the [Custom Marauder Flasher Tool for CYD](https://atomnft.github.io/CM-Box/flash0.html)  
> or built from [CYD-ESP32Marauder](https://github.com/ATOMNFT/CYD-ESP32Marauder), you must create a folder on the root of your SD card titled `portals`.  
> 
> This is where you will store the [Evil Portal HTML files](https://github.com/ATOMNFT/CYD-ESP32Marauder/tree/master/Evil%20Portal%20Stuff), including the `index.html` file.

> ## üîß **Building This Fork of Marauder from Source** üîß  
> 
> Follow these steps to build this fork of Marauder for your CYD module:  
> 
> ### Step 1: Start with Smoochiee‚Äôs Tutorial  
> Head over to [Smoochiee's tutorial](https://github.com/smoochiee/Marauder-FOR-CYD---CHEAP-YELLOW-DISPLAY) and begin from Step 1.  
> 
> ### Step 2: Libraries Setup  
> When you reach the **"LIBRARIES"** section:  
> - You can use the libraries linked in Smoochiee's tutorial.  
> - Alternatively, use the libraries provided in **this repository**, as they are identical.  
> 
> ### Step 3: Use Modified Source Files  
> On the step where Smoochiee directs you to download Marauder's source code:  
> - Instead of the original files, download the pre-modified files from one of the following:  
>   - [CYD ESP32 Marauder 13.10 (NoGPS)](https://github.com/ATOMNFT/CYD-ESP32Marauder/tree/master/CYD%20ESP32%20Marauder%2013.10%20(NoGPS))  
>   - [CYD ESP32 Marauder 1.0.0 (NoGPS)](https://github.com/ATOMNFT/CYD-ESP32Marauder/tree/master/CYD%20ESP32%20Marauder%201.0.0%20(NoGPS))
>   - [CYD ESP32 Marauder 1.1.0 (NoGPS)](https://github.com/ATOMNFT/CYD-ESP32Marauder/tree/master/CYD%20ESP32%20Marauder%201.1.0)
> These files include all necessary sketch edits.  
> 
> ### Step 4: Complete the Tutorial  
> Return to [Smoochiee's tutorial](https://github.com/smoochiee/Marauder-FOR-CYD---CHEAP-YELLOW-DISPLAY) and continue with the remaining steps.  
> 
> ---
> 
> ### Coming Soon: My Custom Tutorial  
> I‚Äôll soon be adding my own guide for flashing this build to your CYD module. Stay tuned!
