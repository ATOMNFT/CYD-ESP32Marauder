  # Adjusted sd card portal storage
  I have tweaked a section of two files (EvilPortal.cpp & SDInterface) to allow the portals used in EP to be stored in a folder on the sd card instead of just being stored in the root of sd card<br>
  with all the pcaps and other files captured. 
  </b>
  <br> 
  <b>The folder titled "SD portal fix" contains two files that you must use to replace files in the <a href=" https://github.com/ATOMNFT/CYD-ESP32Marauder/tree/master/esp32_marauder>esp32_marauder folder.</a></b>
  <br>
  <b>I'm not sure if other devices face this issue as I do not own a JCMKK box. But your more than welcome to test if your portals are stored in root sd.</b>
