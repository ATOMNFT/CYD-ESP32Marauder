  # Adjusted sd card portal storage
  I have tweaked a section of two files (EvilPortal.cpp & SDInterface) to allow the portals used in EP to be stored in a folder on the sd card instead of just being stored in the root folder.

  <b>The folder must be titled "portals" and I will include a zip with the folder and the ap.config file to upload directly to a sd card to use in the CYD</b>
