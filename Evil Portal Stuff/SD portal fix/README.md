  # Adjusted sd card portal storage
  <b>I have tweaked a section of two files (EvilPortal.cpp & SDInterface.h) to allow the portals used in EP to be stored in a folder on the sd card instead of just being stored in the root folder. </b>

  <b>If you are building to flash for a CYD, use the two files in the zips above according to your marauder version to replace the files in your ESP32Marauder folder.</b>
