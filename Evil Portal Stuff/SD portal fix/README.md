# Adjusted sd card portal storage
<b>I have tweaked a section of two files (EvilPortal.cpp & SDInterface.h) to allow the portals used in EP to be stored in a folder on the sd card instead of just being stored in the root folder.</b>

## SD Setup for CM-Box
If you flashed from the <a href=https://atomnft.github.io/CM-Box/flash0.html>Custom Marauder Flasher tool for CYD</a> or built from <a href=https://github.com/ATOMNFT/CYD-ESP32Marauder>CYD-ESP32Marauder</a> then You must create a folder on the root of your sd card titled "portals". This is where you will store the <a href=https://github.com/ATOMNFT/CYD-ESP32Marauder/tree/master/Evil%20Portal%20Stuff>Evil Portal html files</a> along with the index.html file.

<b>If you are building to flash for a CYD, use the two files in the zips above according to your marauder version to replace the files in your ESP32Marauder folder.</b>
